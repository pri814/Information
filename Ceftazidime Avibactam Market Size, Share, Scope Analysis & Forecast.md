One of the major applications is in the management of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). Ceftazidime avibactam is often prescribed when conventional antibiotics are ineffective due to resistant bacterial strains. This combination antibiotic is particularly effective against Gram-negative bacteria, including those producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases, which complicate treatment options. As healthcare providers face growing challenges with antibiotic resistance, the demand for ceftazidime avibactam in treating cIAIs continues to rise, contributing to the overall growth of the market. Additionally, this drug is utilized in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), where it offers a robust solution against resistant pathogens, thereby expanding its market presence.</p><p>Another significant application of ceftazidime avibactam is in the management of hospital-acquired bacterial infections, including complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs). In hospitals, where the risk of encountering resistant bacterial strains is higher, ceftazidime avibactam provides a critical treatment option. Its effectiveness against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains, makes it a valuable asset in combating infections acquired within healthcare settings. As the incidence of such infections grows and the need for effective treatment options escalates, the market for ceftazidime avibactam is expected to expand further. The increasing use of this antibiotic in both inpatient and outpatient settings underscores its role in addressing complex bacterial infections and driving market growth.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=738058&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=281</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Ceftazidime Avibactam Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Allergan</Li><Li> Pfizer</Li><Li> QILU Pharmaceutical</h3><h3 id="" class="">Ceftazidime Avibactam Market &nbsp;Segments Analysis</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation strategy, the Ceftazidime Avibactam Market research report provides an in-depth analysis of numerous market segments, including application, type, and location.
